FROM meals m
LEFT JOIN reservations r ON m.id = r.meal_id
GROUP BY m.id;
```

#### 2. Advanced Search & Filtering

- Multi-criteria filtering (price, location, cuisine, availability)
- Real-time search with debounced input
- SQL optimization for fast query performance

#### 3. Authentication Flow

- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Persistent sessions across page refreshes
- Protected routes with middleware
- Secure token handling with HTTP-only cookies

#### 4. Review Aggregation

- Real-time rating calculations
- Review sorting and pagination
- Spam prevention and content moderation
